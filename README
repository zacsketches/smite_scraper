I'm building this web scraper for hayden to get the clean URLs for the 
image files related to the pantheon of gods in his favorite game.

From list of URLs he can build his own web page and use the smite.com
images to add some flare to his fan site.

1. curl the main smite website
2. filter it for the lines with the word 'pantheon'
3. regex filter the pantheon for the individual god urls
4. curl each god's url
5. filter each of these god pages to find the image url
6. write an output file with the image urls one to a line
